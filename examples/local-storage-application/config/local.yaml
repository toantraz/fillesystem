# Local Filesystem Configuration
# This configuration uses the local filesystem adapter for file operations
#
# To switch between adapters, simply change the 'type' field:
# - type: 'local' for local filesystem storage
# - type: 's3' for AWS S3 storage
#
# No code changes required - just update the configuration!
